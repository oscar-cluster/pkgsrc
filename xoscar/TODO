* Enable the cluster management. It depends on OPM which is not yet available.
  Sub-tasks:
    - Enable the "-" icons for partition management.
    - Finish the implementation of the "Network Configuration" tab. For a first
      version, we have to:
        * MAC address collection: disable the "Network" and "Manual" options.
        * query ODA to get already defined MAC and IP addresses
    - When selected a file with MAC addresses:
        * allow one to assign a MAC address from the "Unassigned MAC Addresses" 
          widget to a node.
    - Find a way to assign IPs (do not know how to do that right now, current it
      is not possible to let users specify them want to use IPs from x.x.x.x to
      x.x.x.x+number_of_nodes).
* Run "oscar-config --bootstrap" when launching the GUI, except when a 
  "--no-bootstrap" option is used.
* Improve the local management:
    - Check if OSCAR_HOME is set only if we run xoscar for a local management
    - instead of checking if OSCAR_HOME is set, we should look for the OSCAR
      configuration file and get the location of the OSCAR scripts.
