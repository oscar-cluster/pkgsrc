* Enable the cluster management. It depends on OPM which is not yet available.
  Sub-tasks:
    - Enable the "-" icons for partition management.
    - Finish the implementation of the "Network Configuration" tab. For a first
      version, we have to:
        * MAC address collection: disable the "Network" and "Manual" options.
    - When selected a file with MAC addresses:
        * allow one to assign a MAC address from the "Unassigned MAC Addresses" 
          widget to a node.
    - Find a way to assign IPs (do not know how to do that right now, current it
      is not possible to let users specify them want to use IPs from x.x.x.x to
      x.x.x.x+number_of_nodes).
* Run "oscar-config --bootstrap" when launching the GUI, except when a 
  "--no-bootstrap" option is used.
* Implement a transparent remote OSCAR command execution mechanism that will 
  allow users to use the GUI on their laptop and to give remotely OSCAR.
  The capability to switch between local and remote management creates a
  problem: we do not know any more if the commands to execute will take a
  while or not. The problem here is that if the command is a long running
  command and executed in the main thread of the application (the Qt thread)
  the application while freeze the time of the command execution, which
  creates a weird behavior of the GUI.
  To address the problem, a solution is to execute _all_ commands in a
  separate thread. In the thread, when preparing the command, we call a
  commandBuilder class which knows how to prepare the command for the target
  management mode (local -> direct execution of the command; remote -> add
  the ssh stuff).
    - Write a documentation, especially in order to explain the syntax of the
      config file.
