Supported platforms
===================

XOSCAR is designed to work on any platform supporting Qt-4.2.
XOSCAR has been tested on the following systems:
    - Debian Lenny
    - Ubuntu 7.10
    - Centos 5
    - MacOS X

Installation
============

Currently XOSCAR is only available via source code. In order to install XOSCAR
from the source code, please refer to the "How to compile XOSCAR?" section.

How to get the source code?
===========================

* From SVN:
  If you are looking for the development code of XOSCAR, the code is available
  via our SVN repository. You will need both the OSCAR and XOSCAR code.
  More information about how to check-out the OSCAR related code is available 
  here: http://oscar.openclustergroup.org/faq.development.svn-howto for more

  Note that the XOSCAR code is under 'pkgsrc/xoscar':
  (https://svn.oscar.openclustergroup.org/svn/oscar/pkgsrc/xoscar).

How to test the GUI?
====================

2/ Go into the directory where you checked the code out.
3/ Export OSCAR_HOME (needed by OSCAR itself): 'export OSCAR_HOME=`pwd`'
4/ Execute the following command, as root: 
   './scripts/oscar-config --generate-config-file'
5/ As root, check that the '/etc/oscar/oscar.conf' file has the following
   line (if not update): "ODA_TYPE = file"

You are now ready to compile and test XOSCAR.

How to compile XOSCAR?
======================

To compile the GUI:
2/ Go into the XOSCAR directory
3/ Execute: "./configure && make"
4/ Optionally, we can install XOSCAR, executing as root "make install".

Now you should be ready to play with the GUI.

Generation of the doxygen documentation
=======================================

To generate the doxygen documentation, simply execute the following commands
from the source code top-level directory:
    cd src
    doxygen ./doxygen_config
The documentation is generated in the 'doc' directory in the source code 
top-level directory. For instance, the HTML documentation is in 
'doc/html/index.html'.

Generation of the XOSCAR manual
===============================

To generate the xoscar manual, simply execute the following commands from the
source code top-level directory:
    cd doc
    make pdf
The manual is generated i the 'doc' directory (the current directory after
executing the previous commands) and named xoscar_manual.pdf.
It is also possible to generate an HTML version of the manual executing 
'make html' instead of 'make pdf'.
