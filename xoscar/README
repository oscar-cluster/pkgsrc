To generate the doxygen documentation, simply execute the following commands
from the source code top-level directory:

The documentation is generated in the 'doc' directory in the source code 
top-level directory. For instance, the HTML documentation is in

It is also possible to generate an HTML version of the manual executing 
'make html' instead of 'make pdf'.
