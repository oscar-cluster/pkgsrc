Setting up repositories for OSCAR
---------------------------------

OSCAR project support several distributions with different packaging system
(yum or apt), several architectures and several sub-arch (ie i586, i686 for 
i386 arch).

The full repository system aims at building automatically all the binary packages 
from the source packages.

Scripts partially automate the installation of the repository mechanisms. 
Operations which are not automated are documented here in this document.


1 - Setting up automatic build system for apt (Debian)
------------------------------------------------------

First, many informations can be found on http://www.debian.org/devel/buildd/setting-up

1 - Install an etch system.

2 - With LVM, create a volume group with enough space to host all chroot environments
for Debian: 4GB by env (tunable in create_build_env script) + a home partition:

pvcreate /dev/hdaX
vgcreate vg-hda /dev/hdaX

3 - Create a 'home' logical volume in this volume group:

lvcreate -L 2G -n home vg-hda

5 - Run 'make' in this directory. This will install needed packages (buildd and so on),
create build envs for the distros (set in Makefile) and create good directories.

*WRNING* This script is run as root, install software, add user and such things which
can break your system. You're warned.

6 - Allow the buildd user to execute command with sudo without password.
Add the following lines with visudo:

buildd ALL=NOPASSWD:  ALL
Defaults:buildd env_keep+="APT_CONFIG DEBIAN_FRONTEND SHELL"
