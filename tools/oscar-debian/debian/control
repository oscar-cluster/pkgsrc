Description: OSACR (Open Source Cluster Application Resources).
 OSCAR (Open Source Cluster Application Resources) is a snapshot of the best 
 known methods for building, programming, and using High Performance Computing
 (HPC) clusters. It consists of a fully integrated and easy to install software
 bundle designed for high performance cluster computing. Everything needed to
 install, build, maintain, program, and use a Linux cluster is included in the
 suite, making it unnecessary to download or even install any individual software packages on your cluster.
