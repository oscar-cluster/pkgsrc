1.2.5 (not yet released):
- Remove useless debugging messages.
- Better handling of exceptions.
- Fix various issues for the selection of OPKGs (patches from Olivier Lahaye).

1.2.4:
- Fix the Debian copyright.

1.2.3:
- Fix a sequence issue when loading the OSCAR::RepositoryManager Perl module
in SelectorTable.pm.

1.2.2:
- Patch from Thilo: speed up the populate of the GUI table.

1.2.1:
- Fix various issues with the GUI: because of the code separation between the
GUI and the rest of the code, we had to create a new namespace for the Perl
modules related to the GUI. The support of this new namespace were not fully
implemented.

1.2:
- Add dependency requirement for binary package creation (build.cfg).
- Reorganize the code to separate the GUI code.
- Merge the oscar-selector and selector_cli scripts.
- Fully support package selection/unselection and package set management via
the CLI.
- Update the dependencies for the RPM packages.
- Fix a problem when selecting a packager set other than "Default".

1.1.1:
- Remove debugging messages.
- Slightly improve the Makefile.
- Fix a bug on some Linux distribution when saving package sets (the way XML
files are parsed can be slightly different based on the local Linux
distribution).

1.1:
- Move the PackageSet.pm Perl module from oscar-base to Selector.
- Include a oscar-selector script that enables the management of package sets.

1.0.4:
- Disable the "Manage Set" button since the base code is not ready to support
such a functionality.

1.0.3:
- Modify the Makefile so we can choose the directory to save sources when
creating RPMs.
- Modify the Makefile so we can choose the directory where the binary packages
are stored.
- Enable the creation of unsigned Debian packages by setting the
UNSIGNED_OSCAR_PKG environment variable.

1.0.2:
- Core packages are now always checked (a bug prevented to do so before).
- Core packages cannot be unchecked (a bug prevented to do so before).

1.0.1:
- Clean up and improve the spec file.
- Ease the creation of RPMs.

1.0:
- Separate Selector from the rest of the OSCAR code.
- Include the specification of Selector capabilities.
- Make the implementation based on the specification.
