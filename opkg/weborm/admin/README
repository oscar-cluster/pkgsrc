Prerequirements
===============

On Debian Etch, the following packages are required:
apache2
libapache2-mod-php5
packman
rapt
yume
liboscar

WebORM Overview
===============

o Repositories:
Repositories have a static configuration: all the repositories are created in
the 'repos' directory; and each repository has its own incoming directory in the
'admin/uploads' directory. When users upload binary packages, they are first of all
copied into the uploads directory, and then WebORM checks them. If they are not
binary packages, the uploaded files are simply deleted; if they are, they are
copied into the repository. Finally, the repository meta-data are regenerated.

Note: Make sure the apache process as a write access to this directory.

The creation of the repositories' meta-data is done using packman. Packman is
part of the OSCAR core and provides a nice abstraction of the underlying binary
package management tools. Typically, you do not have to know anything about
the repository you want to create, packman identify the binary package format
and call the appropriate tools.

The WebORM architecture can despicted as:

                        -----------------------
                        |     Web Browser     |
                        | (HTML + Javascript) |
                        -----------------------
                                   |
                                   V

                                   V
                        -----------------------
                        |      Packman        |
                        -----------------------

                   |                               |
               --------                        --------
               | yume |                        | rapt |
               --------                        --------
                   |                               |
                   V                               V
          ---------------------            ---------------------
          |  Yum Repository   |            |  APT Repository   |
          | Management Tools  |            | Management Tools  |
          | (yum, createrepo) |            |    (apt, dpkg,    |
          ---------------------            | dpkg-scanpackage) |
                                           ---------------------

The advantage of such an approach is that we avoid code duplication: the core
component for the management of repositories is PackMan, already used in OSCAR.

Installation
============

1/ Setup a virtual host (it can be the default one, i.e., /var/www most of the
time).
2/ Copy (or check-out) WebORM into that location (not in a sub-directory!).
3/ Configure a restricted access to the webpage:
    a/ Be sure that the configuration for your virtual host as "AllowOverride 
       AuthConfig". Please refer to the apache documentation for more details.
    b/ Add users to the .htpasswd file into the location were you installed
       WebORM. To add a user, assuming you are in the directory where WebORM is
       installed, you can simply type: "htpasswd ./.htpasswd <username>".
4/ Restart apache (e.g., "/etc/init.d/apache2 reload").

WebORM is now ready to go. :-)

Debian Repositories
===================

When managing Debian repository, users can use those repositories simply adding
a new entry into their /etc/apt/sources.list file. The entry will look like:
deb http://repo_url/repos/debian-4-i386/ etch /
