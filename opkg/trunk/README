Here are some hints about configuration of OSCAR repositories.

oscar.gforge.inria.fr host the repository and the incoming packages queue.
Let's call it the 'public' machine.
2 other machines (one FC and one Debian) fetch incoming packages, update
repository and rsync the repository on the public machine. Let's call them
internal machines.

opkg-upload script is used by developpers to upload rpms or debs onto
the 'incoming' package queue.
update-apt.sh and update-yum.sh run on internal machines.

update-apt.sh use reprepro to update apt repository while update-yum.sh use
createrepo.

### reprepro configuration ####
In the directory containing the repository on internal machine (directory
containing dists/ and pool/, create a config/ dir.
In this dir, the 'distributions' file contain the list of available distros.
It looks like:

Codename: etch
Suite: stable
Origin: OSCAR
Label: OSCAR
Description: OSCAR packages for stable
Architectures: i386 amd64 source
Components: main
Uploaders: uploaders.oscar

The 'Uploaders' field point to a file in 'conf/' to manage uploaders rights.
For example, updloaders.oscar may contains:

allow * by unsigned




Please ask me for additional informations. conf/distributions and some other
conf/ files of reprepro are documented in 'man reprepro' but some other
features are not well documented. For instance, reprepro can treat itself an
incoming queue but I don't remember how.
