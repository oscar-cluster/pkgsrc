***  System Installer Installation Guide ***

Prerequisites
------------------------------
*  perl 5.005 (the whole thing is written in perl)
*  AppConfig >= 1.52
*  DBD::CSV >= 0.1027
*  SQL::Statement >= 0.1020
*  Text::CSV_XS >= 0.22

The Perl modules, including AppConfig, can be found on CPAN (www.cpan.org).  
For your convenience a libappconfig-perl rpm package is available on the
System Configurator project page (http://sf.net/projects/systemconfig).  
It should work on most Perl installs.

You can also attempt to install AppConf via the CPAN module by 
running 'perl -MCPAN -e shell' on the command line, and go from there.  
(man CPAN for more info).

The slightly harder way to get them is by downloading the following URLs:
  * http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/ABW/AppConfig-1.52.tar.gz
