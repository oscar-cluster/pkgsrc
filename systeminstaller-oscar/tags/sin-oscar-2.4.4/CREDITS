The original SystemInstaller project development stopped with version
1.04 released in October 2003. Please see below the original CREDITS
file with the contributors to that version. systeminstaller-oscar
is built on top of that project and uses most of its infrastructure.

Since version 1.04 the OSCAR project was the only active user and maintainer of
SystemInstaller. Several extensions were added to version 1.04 and maintained
as patches inside the SRPM file. At the beginning of the year 2006 the OSCAR
specific version of SystemInstaller was finally checked into the OSCAR group's
SVN repository in order to facilitate development and the addition of OSCAR
specific features.
