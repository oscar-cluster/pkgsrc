*** System Installer Project ***

SystemInstaller is a tool to install a system with any Linux distribution. 
It works hand-in-hand with SystemImager and SystemConfigurator to build 
a cluster.

***********************************************************************

Since version 1.04 the OSCAR project was the only active user and maintainer of
SystemInstaller. Several extensions were added to version 1.04 and maintained
as patches inside the OSCAR SRPM file. At the beginning of the year 2006 the OSCAR
specific version of SystemInstaller was finally checked into the OSCAR group's
SVN repository in order to facilitate development and the addition of OSCAR
specific features.

THIS BRANCH OF SYSTEMIMAGER MAKES SENSE ONLY WHEN USED WITH OSCAR!

The integration with OSCAR can onlz be improved if unnecessary components
of SystemImager don't need to be maintained any more. This version will be
systematically stripped by not needed and obsolete components.

        Overview and quick tips
***************************************************************

For more detailed info on SIS in general, including step by step
instructions, see the SIS manpage.

SystemInstaller is a tool to build Linux OS images for use
by SystemImager. It is designed to be distributions and
architecture independent, although we aren't 100% there yet.
After installing the systeminstaller package and optionally, 
the systeminstaller-x11 package, you can get started.

The easiest (and prettiest) way to go about your installation
is to use the SystemInstaller gui, tksis which is in the 
systeminstaller-x11 package (you did install that, didn't you?)
Once you have launched tksis, you can use the panels there to add
new images and clients. 

Optionally there is a text based interactive interface for defining
the necessary components. It is called buildimage and can be run
directly from the command line. It will ask a bunch of questions,
providing defaults where it makes sense. After buildimage completes
you will have an image and clients defined.

There is yet a third option. There is a command line interface for
all the SystemInstaller functions. Briefly, these commands are:

	-mksiimage	Creates a Linux OS image
	-mksidisk	Creates a disk partition table
	-mksirange	Creates a range of machines
	-mksimachine	Edits machine definitions
	-mkdhcpconf	Creates a dhcpd.conf file

See the man pages for these commands for more detail.

In order to actually install the clients, you will need to either
make an autoinstall diskette or CD or setup network booting. See
the SystemImager documentation for more details on this setup.

        Prerequisites
***************************************************************
SystemInstaller is part of the System Installation Suite. As
a result it has several prerequisites on other components of 
SIS(SystemImager and System Configurator). Links to the 
project pages and hence the downloads can be found at 
sisuite.org.

	A note about Debian support
***************************************************************

Debian support was added to SystemInstaller recently, but since
we can't seem to get around the interactive questions that it insists
on asking. So it hasn't been actively maintained, most notably,
it hasn't been modded to support the new API spec. Hopefully the
debconf in the next version of Debian will help with this situation.
If you want to still use the Debian stuff, let us know and we'll 
port it over to the new API.

Here is the original text that was under this item.

Support for .deb packages has recently been added to SystemInstaller,
but only at a very minimal level.  Systeminstaller can create an image
with the base system and any .deb packages which do not require
interactive setup.  This means you must provide in your package list
the base system tarball (base2_2.tgz for debian/stable).

There is a solution to the packages that require interactive setup,
and it is coming RSN.  The short term solution will force the
interactive setup to use the defaults, and the
less-short-term-but-not-far-away solution will allow for you to answer
the questions as they are prompted by the debian setup.
