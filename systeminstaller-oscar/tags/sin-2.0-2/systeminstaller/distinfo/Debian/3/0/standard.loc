## This is a sample --location file for building a Debian >= 3.0 style image,
## using the mksiimage command.  This file is used to generate the
## /etc/apt/sources.list file in the image.
deb http://linuxcoe.fc.hp.com/LinuxCOE/Debian/ woody main contrib
deb http://security.debian.org/ stable/updates main

## You can add additional sources.list here
# Uncomment for the latest SIS releases from sid
#deb http://download.systemimager.org/debian stable main

## This provides the arguments for debootstrap.  deboot lines will be
## stripped when sources.list is written into the image.
deboot http://linuxcoe.fc.hp.com/LinuxCOE/Debian woody
