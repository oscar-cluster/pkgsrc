DESCRIPTION
-----------

v2m (Virtual Machine Management) is a command line interface (CLI) for
libv3m.  This CLI allows users to define and manage virtual machines (VMs)
without having to deal with low-level technical details (network
configuration, config files for each virtualization technology, etc.).


HOW TO INSTALL V2M
------------------

Please read the INSTALL file.

In order to compile v2m, you will also need to specify the path to the
libv3m directory via an option to configure, '--with-libv3m'.  

Note, be careful, the libv3m project is under active development. Therefore
it is highly advised that you provide the path to the libv3m project
directory to enable v2m to have the most recent project updates.
For example, use "./configure --with-libv3m=/my/path/to/libv3m/devel/files",
(for instance "/home/users1/projects/libv3m").


HOW TO USE V2M
--------------

To create/manage a VM, users only have to describe their VM through an XML
file (a DTD is available in the libv3m project, "dtd/v3m_profile.dtd"). 
This XML file is referred to as a "profile". After writing a basic VM profile 
it is possible to boot a VM by just executing: 

    v2m <xml_profile> --boot-vm

Note that the profile will be validated and arguments checked before the
execution of the command.  

To see other usage information, run "v2m" without any arguments.


V2M TESTING
-----------

If you modify V2M or if you want to test a given version of V2M, we may to use
the V2M testing mechanism. For that, go to the 'testing' directory and use the
Makefile (typing 'make').
Several options are available:
  * 'make qemu-basic-test', which tries to boot up a basic VM,
  * 'make qemu-bootcd-test', which tries to start a QEMU VM and boot up from a
    bootable CDROM. Note that the image used for that test is empty.


MISC. SETUP NOTES
-----------------
[qemu]
A few general setup notes relating to Qemu.
 - V2M has been tested using qemu version(s): 0.8.2

 - Create "/etc/v3m/vm.conf" file to specify commands to run prior
   to qemu launch or to specify alternate paths to the qemu binary, etc. 
   see also: "user guide" under 'libv3m/doc/'
   Example: 
      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <config>
          <qemu>
              <command>sudo qemu</command>
              <precommand>sudo modprobe tun</precommand>
          </qemu>
          <xen>
              <command>sudo xm create</command>
          </xen>
      </config>

 - Create "/etc/qemu-ifup" file (remember to make it executable) if you see 
   error messages about launching network scripts. Example "/etc/qemu-ifup",
      #!/bin/sh
      sudo /sbin/ifconfig $1 172.20.0.1
