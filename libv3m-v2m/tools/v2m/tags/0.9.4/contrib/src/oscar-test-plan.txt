# The "PLAN"

Summary:

   + checks
       |--> copy script(s) to headVM (possibly just mount a test-share.img)
       |--> start headVM 
       |--> wait/watch for notification (ready to boot node)
       |      |--> start nodeVM   (w/ CD-rom)
       |      |--> wait/watch for notification (change of PID/shutdown)
       |             |--> start nodeVM (w/o CD-rom)
       |
       |--> cleanup/reap children
       |
       |--> exit


TODO:
  + write top-level hostOS driver script
  + write a simple server to run on hostOS to listen for status/notification
      from headVM to indicate startup of nodeVMs (via --bootscript script)
  + write script to pass to CLI via '--bootscript' option
  + add '--version' option to V2M
  + add '--validate' option to V2M (validate XML, HDD/CD.img file exist, etc)
  + create tar/img with all the scripts & data (XML,*.img) for automation,
      to be used/mounted by the headVM...should be structured as
      hostOS/,  headVM/,  nodeVM/,  etc....


-------------------
0) Sanity check to make sure that v2m is available and at least a
   a simple '--version' (or similar) works. (NOTE: I think I may
   need to add this to ArgumentParser.cpp, so that we get a successful (0)
   return code and not an error (255).

   Do any other prep/checks before starting VM's, etc.  
      - that we have the necessary profiles (headnode.xml, etc.)
      - if possible do a quick check of the profiles/validate XML, disk
        files are available, a "--dry-run" for 'v2m' would be good.

-------------------
1) Start headVM 
        v2m headnode.xml --create-vm

1.1) wait/watch for notification (ready to boot node)


-------------------
2) Start nodeVM with bootCD attached  (capture PID)

2.1) Take a fingerprint of "node-virtual-hdd.img" before booting,
     so that when we get signalled we can tell if it did the install
     or simply timed out from DHCP and is just rebooting?
     (Might want to have a MAX_REBOOT threshold so we don't get into
     infinite loop case.)

2.2) When nodeVM exits, check HDD-fingerprint, if differs, then...
     Start nodeVM without bootCD attached (capture PID)

2.3) Wait for PID...
