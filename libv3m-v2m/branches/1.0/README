Documentation
*************

To compile the documentation, please execute the following command:
    make doc
The documentation is then available in the 'doc' directory. The documentation
is composed of:
- the user documentation in HTML and PDF (user_guided.html and user_guide.pdf),
- the documentation for developers, both in HTML (html/index.html) and PDF
  (to compile the latex files, execute from the top directory of libv3m sources
  'cd doc/latex; make pdf').

Notes for developers
***********************

Note about the binaries needed by libv3m
========================================

The libv3m software uses some pretty big binaries, for instance for the
implementation of a simulated network boot process.
If you get sources from the SVN repository, you will not get automatically
these binaries. In order to get them, please execute the command
'make get-binaries'.

Creation of Debian package
==========================

Just run the standard 'dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot' command.
