1.0:
- Creation of Xen-3.2.1 (paravirtualization and full-virtualization)
  and QEMU-0.9.1 virtual machines based on a XML profile.
- Support the following network configuration:
  * TUN/TAP: a link between the hostOS and the VM is created. In that mode the
    HostOS can host a single VM and the virtual interface on the HostOS has the
    IP 172.20.0.2,
  * a bridged network interface for virtual machines (w/ eth0, it is not
    possible to use another network interface and eth0 cannot be a wireless
    interface).
- Full user documentation.
- Full developer documentation (based on doxygen + basic manual).
