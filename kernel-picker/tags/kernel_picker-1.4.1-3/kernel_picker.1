.SH NAME

.PP
kernel_picker
is a Perl script which allows the user to install 
a given kernel into an OSCAR image different from the one which is 
installed by default.

.SH DESCRIPTION

kernel_picker
allows you to substitute a given kernel into your 
OSCAR (SIS) image prior to building your nodes. If executed with no 
command line options, you will be prompted for all required 
information. You can also specify command line options as shown 
below. Any necessary information that you do not give via an option 
will cause the program to prompt you for that information. 
.PP
The program assumes that the optional OSCAR image files you wish to 
use reside in a subdirectory in the 
/var/lib/systemimager/images
directory. By default, the 
original OSCAR image is in a subdirectory named oscarimage\&.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
[\fB\-\-oscarimage \fP[\fIimage_name\fP]]
 The name of the OSCAR image 
directory. If you use this option but do not specify 
\fIimage_name\fP,
the default directory \&'oscarimage\&'
will be 
used. 
.TP
[\fB\-\-autoselectimage\fP]
 In the event that there are two or more 
OSCAR image directories but you do not want to have to specify one via 
the \&'\-\-oscarimage\&' option (e.g. when you want to call 
kernel_picker
from another program), use this option. (The 
first OSCAR image directory, alphabetcially ignoring case, will be 
used.) Otherwise, you will be presented with a list of OSCAR image 
directories and be asked to choose one to use. 
.TP
[\fB\-\-bootkernel \fP\fIboot_kernel\fP]
 The full path specifier of the 
kernel to use at boot time. This kernel file will be copied to the 
system\&'s boot directory. Also, systemconfig.conf\&'s
PATH option 
will be set approriately. 
.TP
[\fB\-\-bootlabel \fP\fIboot_label\fP]
 The label for the kernel to use at 
boot time. This value is set as the LABEL option in the 
systemconfig.conf
file. If you provide the \fIboot_kernel\fP
but do not provide the \fIkernel_label\fP,
the \fIkernel_label\fP
defaults to the file name specified by the \fIboot_kernel\fP
(without 
any leading path information). 
.TP
[\fB\-\-bootramdisk \fP[\fIY/n\fP]]
 Whether or not to configure a ram disk 
for booting. This value is set as the CONFIGRD option in the 
systemconfig.conf
file. If you do not specify Y or N, it 
defaults to YES. 
.TP
[\fB\-\-networkboot \fP[\fIY/n\fP]]
 Whether or not to use the specified 
\fIboot_kernel\fP
for network booting the nodes during the build 
process. If so, the kernel gets copied to \&'/tftpboot\&'\&.
If you 
do not specify Y or N, it defaults to YES. 
.TP
[\fB\-\-kernelversion \fP\fIversion_number\fP]
 If your boot kernel uses 
loadable modules, you must provide the full version number/name of the 
kernel. This is the value output by the Unix command 
\&'uname \-r\&'\&.
.TP
[\fB\-\-modulespath \fP\fImodules_path\fP]
 If your boot kernel uses 
loadable modules, you must profide the source directory containing the 
/lib/modules/version_number
directory tree. There is no 
need to prepend /lib/modules/version_number
to this 
option (but it doesn\&'t hurt if you do). 
.TP
[\fB\-\-systemmap \fP\fIsystem_map\fP]
 If your boot kernel uses loadable 
modules, you may optionally provide the full path specifier of the 
System.map
file to use by depmod. Enter the full path/file name 
of the source file. This file will be copied to the boot directory. 
.TP
[\fB\-\-version\fP]
 Prints out the version string of the program and 
then quits. 
.TP
[\fB\-\-help\fP]
 Prints out a help message and then quits. 
.PP
.SH GENERAL REMARKS

.TP
1.
kernel_picker does not modify any configuration on the host
machine. 
.TP
2.
When you run the program without any command line options, you will be 
prompted for all required information. If you use any command line 
options, the program will assume that you know what you are doing and 
prompt you ONLY for information which is required for correct 
execution. For example, if you specify the \fB\-\-bootlabel\fP
but not 
any of the options required for loadable modules 
(\fB\-\-kernelversion\fP,
\fB\-\-modulespath\fP,
and \fB\-\-systemmap\fP),
the program will assume that your kernel does not require loadable 
modules and will not prompt you for any of those options. 
.TP
3.
All of the required information is gathered prior to acutally running 
any commands. So you can abort execution before the end and no files 
will be modified/copied. 
.TP
4.
Many of the questions have a default value indicated by bracketed text 
at the end of the question. If this value is okay, simply hit 
<ENTER> to accept it. For most of the questions, the default 
value is probably what you want. 
.TP
5.
If there is only one subdirectory in the 
/var/lib/systemimager/images
directory, it will be used as the 
\fB\-\-oscarimage\fP\&.
.TP
6.
When you enter the \fIboot_kernel\fP, it will be scanned for a
version number string. If found, this will be used as the default 
values for the \fIkernel_label\fP
and \fIversion_number\fP\&.
You can 
override this by entering your own label and version. 
.TP
7.
If you want to run the program from the command line and not be 
prompted for any information, you should invoke the program as 
follows:

.SH REQUIREMENTS

.TP
Perl 
The kernel_picker
script requires Perl version 
>=5.5. 
.TP
Initrd::Generic.pm 
In order to extract the kernel version number 
string from the \fIboot_kernel\fP,
kernel_picker
requires the 
Initrd
package. This is usually found in the 
/usr/lib/systemconfig
directory and is part of the 
systemconfigurator
RPM package.
