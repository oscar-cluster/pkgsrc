   kernel_picker  is  a  Perl  script  which allows the user to install a
   given  kernel  into  an  OSCAR  image  different from the one which is
   installed by default.

Synopsis

   kernel_picker  [--oscarimage  [image_name]] [--bootkernel boot_kernel]
   [--bootlabel  boot_label]  [--bootramdisk [Y/n]] [--networkboot [Y/n]]
   [--kernelversion    version_number]    [--modulespath    modules_path]
   [--systemmap system_map] [--version] [--help]

Description

   kernel_picker  allows you to substitute a given kernel into your OSCAR
   (SIS)  image prior to building your nodes. If executed with no command
   line  options,  you will be prompted for all required information. You
   can  also  specify  command line options as shown below. Any necessary
   information  that you do not give via an option will cause the program
   to prompt you for that information.

   The  program  assumes  that the optional OSCAR image files you wish to
   use  reside  in  a  subdirectory  in  the /var/lib/systemimager/images
   directory.  By  default, the original OSCAR image is in a subdirectory
   named oscarimage.

Options

   [--oscarimage [image_name]]
          The  name  of the OSCAR image directory. If you use this option
          but   do   not   specify   image_name,  the  default  directory
          'oscarimage' will be used.
   [--autoselectimage]
          In the event that there are two or more OSCAR image directories
          but   you   do  not  want  to  have  to  specify  one  via  the
          '--oscarimage' option (e.g. when you want to call kernel_picker
          from  another program), use this option. (The first OSCAR image
          directory,   alphabetcially   ignoring  case,  will  be  used.)
          Otherwise,  you  will  be  presented with a list of OSCAR image
          directories and be asked to choose one to use.
   [--bootkernel boot_kernel]
          The full path specifier of the kernel to use at boot time. This
          kernel  file  will  be  copied  to the system's boot directory.
          Also, systemconfig.conf's PATH option will be set approriately.
   [--bootlabel boot_label]
          The label for the kernel to use at boot time. This value is set
          as  the  LABEL  option  in  the  systemconfig.conf file. If you
          provide  the  boot_kernel  but do not provide the kernel_label,
          the  kernel_label  defaults  to  the file name specified by the
          boot_kernel (without any leading path information).
   [--bootramdisk [Y/n]]
          Whether  or not to configure a ram disk for booting. This value
          is set as the CONFIGRD option in the systemconfig.conf file. If
          you do not specify Y or N, it defaults to YES.
   [--networkboot [Y/n]]
          Whether  or  not  to  use the specified boot_kernel for network
          booting  the  nodes during the build process. If so, the kernel
          gets  copied  to  '/tftpboot'. If you do not specify Y or N, it
          defaults to YES.
   [--kernelversion version_number]
          If your boot kernel uses loadable modules, you must provide the
          full  version  number/name  of  the  kernel.  This is the value
          output by the Unix command 'uname -r'.
   [--modulespath modules_path]
          If your boot kernel uses loadable modules, you must profide the
          source  directory  containing  the  /lib/modules/version_number
          directory    tree.    There    is    no    need    to   prepend
          /lib/modules/version_number to this option (but it doesn't hurt
          if you do).
   [--systemmap system_map]
          If  your  boot kernel uses loadable modules, you may optionally
          provide  the  full path specifier of the System.map file to use
          by  depmod.  Enter  the full path/file name of the source file.
          This file will be copied to the boot directory.
   [--version]
          Prints out the version string of the program and then quits.
   [--help]
          Prints out a help message and then quits.

General Remarks

    1. kernel_picker  does  not  modify  any  configuration  on  the host
       machine.
    2. When  you  run  the  program without any command line options, you
       will  be  prompted  for  all  required information. If you use any
       command  line  options, the program will assume that you know what
       you  are  doing  and  prompt  you  ONLY  for  information which is
       required  for  correct  execution. For example, if you specify the
       --bootlabel  but  not  any  of  the  options required for loadable
       modules  (--kernelversion,  --modulespath,  and  --systemmap), the
       program  will  assume  that  your kernel does not require loadable
       modules and will not prompt you for any of those options.
    3. All  of  the  required  information  is gathered prior to acutally
       running  any  commands.  So you can abort execution before the end
       and no files will be modified/copied.
    4. Many  of the questions have a default value indicated by bracketed
       text at the end of the question. If this value is okay, simply hit
       <ENTER> to accept it. For most of the questions, the default value
       is probably what you want.
    5. If there is only one subdirectory in the
       /var/lib/systemimager/images  directory,  it  will  be used as the
       --oscarimage.
    6. When  you  enter the boot_kernel, it will be scanned for a version
       number  string.  If found, this will be used as the default values
       for  the kernel_label and version_number. You can override this by
       entering your own label and version.
    7. If  you  want  to run the program from the command line and not be
       prompted  for  any  information,  you should invoke the program as
       follows:
       kernel_picker    --bootkernel    boot_kernel    --bootramdisk    N
       --networkboot N

Requirements

   Perl
          The kernel_picker script requires Perl version >=5.5.
   Initrd::Generic.pm
          In  order  to extract the kernel version number string from the
          boot_kernel, kernel_picker requires the Initrd package. This is
          usually  found  in  the  /usr/lib/systemconfig directory and is
          part of the systemconfigurator RPM package.

Version
