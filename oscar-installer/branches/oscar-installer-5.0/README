Installation
============

+ From the tarball:
    - Untar the oscar-installer tarball
      For instance, to install oscar-installer version 1.0, type:
        tar -xzf ./oscar-install-1.0.tar.gz
    - Go to the oscar-installer directory
      For instance, to install oscar-installer version 1.0, type:
        cd oscar-installer-1.0
    - Execute the 'perl Makefile.PL && make' command
    - Execute the 'make install' command
  You are now ready to use oscar-installer. For more information about 
  oscar-installer, please refer to the man page ('man oscar-installer').
+ From the RPM:
    - download the RPM,
    - use the command 'rpm -Uvh <rpm_name.rpm>' to actually install the RPM.

Creation of a new release
=========================

To create a tarball for a new release, follow the following actions:
- update the 'VERSION' file (remeber that the version of oscar-installer
  must be the same that the OSCAR version oscar-installer is supposed to
  install),
- update the list of supported distros in the 'conf/oscar-installer.conf'
  configuration file,
- update in the 'conf/oscar-installer.conf' file the URL for the documentation
  on how to setup a repository for the target Linux distribution,
- update the md5sum file URL in the 'conf/oscar-installer.conf',
- check that the list of files that is shipped for the OSCAR installation
  is still the same; if not you will have to slightly modify the code,
- execute the 'make manifest' command,
- execute the 'make dist' command.
Then you should have a tarball that correspond to the version you want to 
release (e.g., oscar_installer-5.0.tar.gz).

Creation of a new RPM
=====================

You need first to create a new tarball (for that see the section "Creation of a
new release"). Copy the created tarball in /usr/src/rpm/SOURCES, then execute
the command 'rpmbuild -bb ./oscar-installer.spec' from the directory were the
oscar-installer code is.
