1.4.0:
- [Ticket #532] Implement a cache when detecting the format of repositories.
- [Ticket #548] Fixes a bug in the cache management for repositories' formats
which created the problem in the upper layers of the architecture. 
- Patch from Thilo: update the default cache file to include the CentOS mirror
that are currently used.
- Remove some debugging information.

1.3:
- Revisit the non-interactive mode to center the capabilities around the
notion of "distribution" (which is actually the level of abstraction ORM is
supposed to provide).
- [Ticket #252] Local caches are not anymore used, we directly query
repositories (modification due to the fact that we now deal with both online
and local repositories).

distribution and we can now select different Linux distributions and query
them.
- [Ticket #382] It is now possible to query repositories in interactive mode
(based on the current distribution).
- [Ticket #513] Add an option to the interactive mode ("info") to display
repositories associated to the current Linux distribution.

- Fix a problem when using OS_Detect.
- Modify the Makefile so we can choose the directory to save sources when

are stored.
- Enable the creation of unsigned Debian packages by setting the
UNSIGNED_OSCAR_PKG environment variable.

1.2:
