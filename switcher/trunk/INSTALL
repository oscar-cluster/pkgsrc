Installation
============

The switcher packages use a standard automake-based configure and
"make install".  Most of the time, users will install this package
via RPM, so reading this file is unnecessary.

However, if someone has a burning desire to compile from source,
configure takes three important options:

1. --prefix=DIR: the directory where switcher will be installed
2. --with-modulefiles=DIR: the directory base where the switcher
   module itself should be installed
3. --enable-suppress-errors: since env-switcher is involved in the
   startup of *EVERY SHELL SESSION* on your machine, it is *CRITICAL*
   to understand what this option does before proceedings.  See
   "Shell Startup Errors", below.

A standard "make all install" will do the deed.


Shell Startup Errors
====================

There is a strong religious debate in the system administrator
community about how to handle errors at shell startup.  

- One camp says that outputting messages to stderr is acceptable, even
  though this makes some utilities fail (e.g., scp, sftp, cpush,
  etc.).  The rationale multi-fold:

  1. You always want to know when there is a problem with shell
     startup.  Otherwise, some executables (for example) may
     mysteriously disappear from user's paths, and there is no
     explanation as to why they are gone.
  2. Even though *some* utilities fail, others do not.  It is always
     possible to fix the shell startup error without much effort.
  3. Other utilities write errors to stderr upon failure, even during
     shell startup (e.g., xauth, ssh itself, etc.).

- The other camp says that you should *never* output anything to
  stderr.  Errors should be handled or discarded silently.  Users have
  to fend for themselves and try to figure out why certain
  executables, libraries, or man pages have seemingly disappeared,
  even though they have specific defaults to make them appear.

  The main rationale is that outputting to stderr causes some
  utilities to fail (in some cases, unavoidably -- for example,
  there's really no good way for scp to *not* fail if something is
  written to stderr).

I firmly fall in the former camp (if something is wrong, you should be
notified, even if it causes other things to fail).  Indeed, I added
capabilities to env-switcher a long, long time ago to make switcher
not display errors -- it simply required running a single switcher
command.  But some lazy system administrators need the default set for
them during configuration.  

The end result is that it really doesn't matter that much.
Env-switcher now has a configure switch "--enable-suppress-errors"
that will set switcher's default behavior in the presence of errors.

The name is meant to emphasize the magnitude of what you are doing:
you are supressing env-switcher from showing legitimate errors.  You
have been warned.  :-)
