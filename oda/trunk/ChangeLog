1.2:
- Fix different bugs in SQL syntax (introduced during the merge of the OSCAR
branch-5-1 into trunk).
- Clean up the bootstrapping (the database password was generated twice).
- Include the missing make_database_password script when using Make commands.
- Fix a bootstrapping issue: we were refering to OSCAR::oda even where the
bootstrapping was not complete, ending in errors.

1.1:
- Add the automatic create and initialization of the database.
- Continue to move many ODA scripts from OSCAR trunk.
- Add a dedicated Perl module for the bootstrapping.

1.0:
- Separate ODA from the rest of the OSCAR code.
