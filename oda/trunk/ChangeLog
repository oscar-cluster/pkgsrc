"verbose" and "debug" to manage the level of verbosity while running.
- Fix a bug in Database.pm (update_node_package_status).

1.3.3:
- Fix two problems in the populate_oda_packages_table script: we were detecting
the compatible distro instead of the real distro; the query to detect OPKGs was
wrong on RPM based systems.

Database.pm.

branch-5-1 into trunk).
- Clean up the bootstrapping (the database password was generated twice).
- Include the missing make_database_password script when using Make commands.
