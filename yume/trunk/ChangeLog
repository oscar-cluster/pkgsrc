yume-2.8.17:
- Fix "Calling POSIX::tmpnam() is deprecated".
- Fix package manager requirement (yum or dnf depending on distro)
yume-2.8.16:
- Add preliminary support for dnf (yum replacement in newer fedora/rhel
distros)
yume-2.8.15:
- Adapt to new oscarsamples filesystem hierarchy.
yume-2.8.14:
- use plugins=1 so official repos are used in redhat-el systems.
yume-2.8.13:
- Added the possibility to install generic provides like 'perl(Pod::Man)'
  => yume install 'perl(Pod::Man)' 'glibc-devel(x86-32)'
yume-2.8.12:
- Added the possibility to install, update, remove a "feature".
  A feature can be: a package name, a file (with absolute path), a "provide".
- Added a requirement for oscar-utils (/usr/bin/distro-query needed even on nodes)
- Updated the spec file and Makefile so it ptty_try.1 is generated and
packaged
- Fixed distro-query parsing for repo autodetection
- Use on_oscar_master() in distro_repo to detect we are on master node.
- Suggest repoquery if the rpm version supporting the "suggest" tag is 
installed (patch from Olivier Lahaye).
- Automatically detect the source directory for RPM based system (patch from
O. Lahaye).

yume-2.8.11:
- [Ticket #575] Fix a problem with the return code for some errors.

yume-2.8.10:
- Include the support for i586 RPMs.

yume-2.8.9:
- Finer grain management of output.

yume-2.8.8:
- Fix various issues when OSCAR is installed directly on the system.

yume-2.8.7:
- Update the package architecture detection mechanism.

yume-2.8.6:
- Make the seach and info options really work (previously we had no output).
- Correctly check if packages are available before installation.
- Add the detection of the architecture of only repositories.
- Correctly run on Debian based systems.
- Correctly detect package architecture.
- Add a debug option to get even more output.

yume-2.8.5:
- Remove uneeded debugging messages.
- Modify the Makefile so we can choose the directory to save sources when
creating RPMs.
- Modify the Makefile so we can choose the directory where the binary packages
are stored.
- Enable the creation of unsigned Debian packages by setting the
UNSIGNED_OSCAR_PKG environment variable.

yume-2.8.4:
- Fix a bug when checking if a package is available before installation.
- Improve the management of the verbose mode, we can really use the verbose
option or the env variable, and have the same behavior.
- Fix a problem in the return code catching in ptty_try.

yume-2.8.3:
- Extend ptty_try so we can catch the return code of executed commands and
return it back to the user (therefore PackMan can catch errors). Contribution
to close [Ticket #509].
- Extend yume so we can catch errors from yum. Contribution to close [Ticket
#509].
- Add a framework for unit tests + some basic unit tests.
- [Ticket #452] Yume now returns an error code when we try to install a
package that is not available.

yume-2.8.2:
- add a "deb" target to the Makefile (needed by oscar-packager).
- fix the "make dist" command.

yume-2.8.1:
- improve the man page (by adding examples).
- slightly improve the Makefile.
- add a separate ChangeLog file that could be used both with RPM and Debian
packages

yume-2.8:
- added master recognition for failover case (heartbeat version).

yume-2.7:
- fix a bad handling of the return code.
- added repoadd, repodel, repolist repository manipulation funtionality for
OSCAR headnodes.

yume-2.6:
- certain yum versions are too chatty, fixed version detection

yume-2.5:
- fixed repoquery for newer yum versions

yume-2.3:
- Improved scalability by dealing with timeouts when calling distro-query
- More detailed errors

yume-2.2:
- fixed problem with yume invocation on SUSE clients
- suse_bootstrap support for installing into empty suse images
- including yum-repoquery and removing dependency of yum-utils.
- added rpm groups support (e.g. yume install @eclipse)
- added repoquery support (--repoquery)
- moved ptty_try log file to /tmp, cleaning it up at interruption
- added mirror:http://mirrorlist_url/ option handling
- significantly improved functionality of yume-opkg
- limit architectures of installed packages (if not specified), this should
avoid installing all compatible architectures of a package on a x86_64. Detects
arch from name of repository.
- added env variable YUME_VERBOSE
- added debugging output
- added correct return codes when subcommands fail
- removed need for "--" to separate yum arguments
- changed exported repository URL path to /repo/$repopath
- added default repository detection for OSCAR clusters.

yume-0.3:
- added ptty_try (otherwise no progress bar in systeminstaller)

yume-0.2:
- chop trailing "/" from repo paths, otherwise getting trouble with basename

yume-0.1:
- added yume-opkg
- added rpmlists for rhel4 i386 and x86_64 to /usr/share/yume
