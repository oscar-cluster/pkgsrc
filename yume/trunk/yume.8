.SH NAME
yume \- yum wrapper for easy cluster management
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B yum OPTIONS [YUM_OPTIONS]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Yume
is a tool for setting up, exporting yum repositories and executing
yum commands for only these repositories. Use it as high level RPM
replacement which resolves dependencies automatically.

This tool is very useful for managing clusters which are running distributions
using the rpm package format. It can:
.br
 - prepare an rpm repository
.br
 - export it through apache
.br
 - execute yum commands applying only to this repository (locally)
.br
 - execute yum commands on the cluster nodes applying only to this repository.
.br
This makes installing packages, creating cluster node images, updating
revisions much simpler than with rpm.


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B --repo URL :
repository which should be included in yum actions (multiple --repo options
are possible). If no --repo option is passed, yume tries to detect the default
repository names dynamically. This feature only works on an OSCAR cluster, on
both master- and client-nodes.

.TP
.B --export :
create httpd configuration for local repositories. The repositories have to be
passed by using --repo. The URL will be /repo/repopath on the local
web server. This command fails if the configuration path for the webserver is
not detected. Be careful and avoid having the same basename for two
repositories.

.TP
.B --unexport :
delete httpd configuration for local repositories. Pass repositories with the
--repo option.

.TP
.B --listexp :
list local repositories which are exported via http.

.TP
.B --prepare :
generate repodata for local repositories. This calls "createrepo" and
generates the package independent repository metadata in the repodata/
subdirectory.

.TP
.B --help :
display help information.

.TP
.B --verbose :
verbose output. Multiple specifications of this option lead to higher
verbosity.

Setting the environment variable $YUME_VERBOSE to a number between 1 and
10 will generate verbose output like multiple -v options.



.SH EXAMPLES

Suppose you have installed a distribution like RHEL3 update4 on your system
and would like to upgrade it to RHEL3 update5. If your system is not connected
to the internet, you won't be able to run up2date for doing this. Create a
repository for the update5 RPMs (for example /tftpboot/rpms_u5) and copy all
RPMs from the ISOs or CDs to it.

Next steps:

.TP
.B yume --prepare --repo /tftpboot/rpms_u5
creates repository metadata in /tftpboot/rpms_u5/repodata. This step is needed
as yum relies on the existence and freshness of this metadata.

.TP
.B yume --repo /tftpboot/rpms_u5 -- check-update
checks which packages need updating. The action is limited to the rpms
in /tftpboot/rpms_u5 and ignores any other repositories (like those in
/etc/yum.conf.c/).

.TP
.B yume --repo /tftpboot/rpms_u5 update
updates packages by invoking
.RB yum update
and limiting the RPMs search to those in the given repository.

.TP
.B yume --export --repo /tftpboot/rpms_u5
creates the httpd configuration file for exporting the repository data through
apache. The URL will be http://servername/repo/tftpboot/rpms_u5 .

.TP
.B yume --repo http://servername/repo/tftpboot/rpms_u5 update
Updates the RPMs with yum, uses the repository accessed through http. This is
useful for updating cluster nodes from a central repository.

.TP
.B yume --repo /tftpboot/rpm --repo /tftpboot/oscar install oscarpackage
Installs the package oscarpackage locally, resolves dependencies by searching
the two repositories specified by --repo.

.TP
.B yume --repo /tftpboot/rpm --repo /tftpboot/oscar --installroot /var/lib/systemimager/images/oscarimage install `cat pkglist`
installs the packages listed in the file pkglist into the image specified by
the --installroot yum option. Useful for creating client node images.

When used on an OSCAR cluster the repositories default to the distribution
specific repository locations. These can be displayed by using the command
$OSCAR_HOME/scripts/distro-query.

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
Exit status is normally 0.
If an error occurs, exit status is nonzero.

.SH BUGS
None ;-)
