- Improve the Makefile: 
    * 'make dist', creates a tarball that can be used to release RAPT,
    * 'make clean', deletes junky file (e.g. *~),
    * 'make mrproper', deletes all files generated during the compilation and
      the creation of binary packahes.
- Clean up the RAPT output.
- Switch the aptitude instead of apt-get.
- Fix the bug with the error return code. RAPT was previously always returning
  0.
