possible). This fixes bug #450.

rapt-2.0
- Support multiple architectures.
- Enable the building of the Debian package as a normal user (no need to be

rapt-1.2
- Improve the Makefile: 
* 'make dist', creates a tarball that can be used to release RAPT,
* 'make clean', deletes junky file (e.g. *~),
* 'make mrproper', deletes all files generated during the compilation and the
creation of binary packahes.
- Clean up the RAPT output.
- Switch to aptitude instead of apt-get.
- Fix the bug with the error return code. RAPT was previously always returning
0.
