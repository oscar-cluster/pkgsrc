rapt-2.8.11:
- Fix a critical bug in repo management. If --installroot / was used
(oscar-config does this), rapt was trying to debbootstrap / thinking it was
an image. then, it was failing, trying to access local repo thru
http://127.0.0.1/repo/tftpboot/... just as if it was running and a chrooted
image).
- Fix a missleading error message.

rapt-2.8.10:
- Do not require the dependency to OSCAR::ImageMgt except when really required
(dynamic versus static load of the Perl module).

rapt-2.8.9:
- Port to Ubuntu 12.04.
- Update copyrights.

rapt-2.8.8:
- Fix a problem when dealing with the lock file.
- Fix a typo in a function's name.
- Improve the man page.

rapt-2.8.7:
- Decrease the sleep time when waiting for the lock release.
- Clean-up the code.
- Improve output.
- Improve the man page.
- Fix a problem when using the --distro option (repos were not correctly
handled).

rapt-2.8.6:
- Remove debugging messages.
- Fix a problem when creating the list of repositories, previously the array
was not correctly created when a config file from /tftpboot included several
repositories.

rapt-2.8.5:
- [Ticket #538] The distro codename detection is now based on OS_Detect.
- [Ticket #398] To be able to check whether all Debian packages from a list of
packages are available, we need to get the list of all available Debian
packages. A bug previously prevented to get the list of all available
packages, this is now fixed.
- [Ticket #545] The generation of repository meta-data is now based on the
repository codename and not anymore on local distro codename.

rapt-2.8.4:
- Modify the Makefile so we can choose the directory where the binary packages
are stored.
- Enable the creation of unsigned Debian packages by setting the
UNSIGNED_OSCAR_PKG environment variable.

rapt-2.8.3:
- Minor modification for the oscar-packager support: add a "make rpm" command
(which only displays a message).
- Improve the man page.

rapt-2.8.2:
- Fix a bug when specifying the architecture for bootstrapping (introduced
during the last release).

rapt-2.8.1:
- Fix a bug in get_debootstrap_mirror_and_codename: bad return code check when
searching for a specific repositories in configuration files.
- Fix a bug when specifying the architecture (we were not always translating 
"x86_64" to "amd64").

rapt-2.8:
- Fix the codename detection for Ubuntu (detect gutsy and hardy).
- Implement a correct usage of debootstrap, it previously worked only with
Etch.
- Include the capability of specifying the distro ID, which allows users to
not have to specify all other details (such as repositories). It also
simplifies the distro bootstrapping.

rapt-2.7:
- Bug fix when searching packages or querying information about packages.

rapt-2.6:
- Bug fix: the return code should now be correct all the time.

rapt-2.5:
- Bug fix (#490): repo's meta-data are regenerated even when they already
exist.

rapt-2.4
- Bug fix: rapt does not exist if the repos architecture cannot be detacted
(which is often the case with Debian systems when all OSCAR repos are online
repos).
- Minor modifications of RAPT output.
- Enable the usage of distro_query when distro_query is installed in
(/usr/bin).

rapt-2.3
- Include the Ubuntu support.

rapt-2.2
- Bug fixes.
- Manpage improvement.

rapt-2.1
- Switch back to apt-get instead of aptitude (keyring problems).
- When detecting repositories architecture, skip online repositories.
- When using multiple repositories, the list of repos is correctly build
internaly (bug #455).
- Improve the error handling. This fixes bug #458.
- Correctly deal with the different repo location notation (i.e., the location
can start by http|ftp, file:, or even be an absolute path).
- Automatically detect the mirror that can be used by debootstrap (when
possible). This fixes bug #450.
- Support the "names-only" option.
- Add a 'uninstall' target to the Makefile.

rapt-2.0
- Support multiple architectures.
- Enable the building of the Debian package as a normal user (no need to be
root anymore).

rapt-1.2
- Improve the Makefile: 
* 'make dist', creates a tarball that can be used to release RAPT,
* 'make clean', deletes junky file (e.g. *~),
* 'make mrproper', deletes all files generated during the compilation and the
creation of binary packahes.
- Clean up the RAPT output.
- Switch to aptitude instead of apt-get.
- Fix the bug with the error return code. RAPT was previously always returning
0.
